# IssueParser

"Create an app that is capable of visualizing the contents of the attached csv file on the screen. Make sure you do not block the UI thread during parsing and please be aware that we have other internal csv files that we will use to validate your work."

Using the file "issues.csv" as an example, the app tries to make the parsing the most generic possible. 
Did that way, cause when asked it was said that the patterns from the csv files could be different.

The first screenasks for the name of the file, just to make it easier to test, this way you can put several files in the app and choose which you want to parse.
It was done using the MVC pattern, using Storyboards with a NavigationController to make it easier to parse different files.
